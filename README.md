# SDA Assignment 2

## Project Structure

Android studio project with 2 modules, `part1` and `part2`.

## Part 1

Contains an application with the solution to the lab exercises.
Fully functional, all exercises are implemented.

## Part 2

Contains an application with the solution to the assignment.
Mostly functional, images are not saved to the gallery. I feel like I was on the right patch but I
couldn't figure out the last part in time. There are some debugging logs left in the code to show
that the image intent is resolving correctly with the file path. I suspect I need to simply move
that file to the correct folder.

## How to run the modules

Open the project in Android Studio and run the desired module (part1 or part2).

A new configuration may be needed for each module, if Android Studio does not automatically create
one.
